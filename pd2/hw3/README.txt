Here is a short comment to all the other results included:

Log histogram of node degrees has a clear straight line pointing downwards. This is the proof that the network is scale-free.

The network is low density, since there are few connections between nodes compared to their numbers. Average degree is about 5 (2 * 9000 / 3610), which is low for a 3610-node network.

There are two key players that have significantly higher mean centrality (computed as mean of betweenness and closeness, both rescaled first to [0, 1] range). These are FBgn0039395 and FBgn0036248, known as CG14546 and ssp.
